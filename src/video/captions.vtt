Today, we experience the
moving image in a
relatively small rectangle
on the screen,

1
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:27.000
often displayed alongside
ads, comments, and suggestions
of other videos.
Video sharing platforms
are indifferent to ambiance
but it doesn’t necessarily
have to be this way!

2
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:55.000
Imagine a media player
that could grow in
order to emphasize a
specific moment in a
story, spin around to get
your point across, 
change the website’s
background color to reflect
a brighter tone, or even
shake the screen and keep
your audience focused on
the video.
Yes, that would be great!

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:28.000
If you happen to be
selling a product, you
could fill up the website
with “Buy Now” buttons.
Once those buttons are gone,
you could remind your
audience that purchasing
something on your website
is a private, safe affair — 
in fact, you could go even
further and announce that
the entire experience is
encrypted, so you’ll never
really know what’s happening
behind the scenes.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:57.000
Selling is not the only    
thing you can do 
on the internet. You can 
also inform. The problem 
with using video to inform
is that videos are, 
by nature of the medium,
stuck in time. This additional
layer I’m proposing could pull
in real time information to 
complement the message 
you are trying to convey.

5
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:22.000
I’m personally excited 
about having fun with 
this idea, perhaps by messing
around with viewers, pausing 
the video at a random time 
and making them think their 
internet connection went down.
Similar to what happened in 
the Sopranos finale.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:03:03.000
This concept also presents 
interesting opportunities for 
content accessibility. 
I’ve always thought Youtube 
should give creators the 
option to upload an auxiliary 
sign language video as an 
alternative to text-only 
captions: users could toggle it 
on or off based on preference.
Since that feature doesn’t 
exist yet, consider this 
a proposal within a proposal.

7
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:40.000
To be clear, the video file 
you see here is identical to 
the one you’d upload to a video 
sharing platform. 
The embellishments are simply 
a layer that rewards viewers 
who happen to watch it on your 
own site instead of Youtube 
or Vimeo. If you really care 
about view counts, most video 
services offer APIs that allow 
you to accomplish the same results.

8
00:03:40.010 --> 00:04:00.000
This is a nascent idea, and 
I hope it inspires others to 
ditch the race for algorithmic 
relevance and pursue genuinely 
intriguing experiences for 
internet users all around.
